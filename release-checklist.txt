

	HIGH PRIORITY
Areas which are a little underpopulated, come up reasonably often, and don't require very complicated new patterns to be added.

* Reflective Choice/.../Big Mood/Targeted Resonance: words associated with thematic meaning
* Reflective Choice/.../Big Mood/Weirdly Specific Mood: very specific random feels
* Reflective Choice/Basic Choice Menus/Connecting Phrases: all lists, but especially nextbottle
* Memory/A Little Context/Seasons: springthings, etc.: associations of seasons
* Memory/Gifts/.../Corsetry:
	* for some reason ikons and t-ikons ended up here: they are visual motifs that might appear in various contexts, such as on perfume bottles and in cloth patterns
* Memory/Named Characters:
	* nations, a list of predominantly-Europea-and-neighbours nations (including historical ones)
* Memory/Complex Memory:
	* knowconclusion, realisations about perfume that at first you couldn't identify
		* also something about magazine names other than just 'Hers', which is all wrong
	* memimperfect, longimperfect: details from an entire period in one's life
	* groupmainact: doing stupid things together with a friend
		* groupdetails: details of doing stupid things, etc.
	* soloaction: a memorable evening doing things alone
* Memory/Unique Memory/First Perfume - this is the only unique that definitely needs to be fleshed out before release
* Memory/Bottles:
	* ornate-bottledescs, patterns for more ornate or specific bottles. The balance isn't ideal here, but this might be a matter of weighting rather than More Content
	


	MEDIUM PRIORITY
Lists which are OK as they stand, but which would benefit from being deeper.

* Scent/Scent Styles: more adjectives and nouns for Themes
* Scent/Scent Notes/Hints: strange/bad smells that you wouldn't normally expect in perfume
* Scent/Scent Notes/Multikinds: more aromatic woods, flowers, fungi
* Scent/Scent Notes/Adjectives: Regions
* Reflective Choice/.../Big Mood/Random Resonance: micro-res, structures for random meanings
* Memory/Gifts: just a whole lot of stuff, but especially:
	* narrative-titles: patterns for titles of plays and potentially other Literary Works
	* buckscoda: take-away stories from commercial projects
	* starjob: kinds of celebrity who might have celebrity-branded perfume
		* sportsball: sports they might play
	* brandnames: perfume lines the protag released
	* fortunatetail: conclusions to memories of fortuitously-crafted scents
	* genericadjectives: characteristic qualities of unnamed gift-givers/recipients
* Memory/Named Characters/.../Namelists:
	* more names for the thinner existing name-lists
* Memory/Complex Memory/
	* partytimes: add more intimate, less huge-official-ball kinds of party
	* modelshapes: physical adjectives describing unnamed NPCs
	* convtopics: subjects of memorable conversations
		* gentopics, just a list of topics without complex generation involved
	* artefforts: an NPC's artistic projects
	* eranames, gubberments, etc: names of periods in recent history
	* cocktails: cocktail names
	* suitoradjs: characteristic adjectives of (unnamed?) lovers
	* suitornats: nationality/ethnicity of lovers
	* Roles, and adjectives breaking out of that
	* sidelines: hobbies or crafts that the protagonist might have taken up incidentally
* Memory/Unique Memory/Death: relfave, connecting the scent to a dead relative
* Memory/Bottles:
	* bottlemats of N, colours of glass corresponding with themes
	* bottledescs, details of bottles
	* bottle-styles, eras or schools of jewelry style
	* classical-subjs of N: answering the very important question 'which Greek gods were the most goth'

	


	QUESTIONABLE PRIORITY
Would be useful, but would involve more complex patterns.

* Scent/Assembler: more variations on how perfume descriptions are constructed
* Memory/Gifts: selfreasons, snapshots of the protagonist's profession and craft
* Memory/Gifts: gifts/antigifts, which may be too simple at this point?
* Memory/Gifts/Scented Things:
	* scentedgifts, context structures for gift-giving events
	* gaveparen: more detailed context of/reasons for why an NPC gave a gift
* Memory/Gifts/.../Leatherwork, Clothing: more patterns for fancy scent-imbued things
* Memory/Fashions: this section is underdeveloped and could use more simple patterns
* Memory/Named Characters:
	* didpara: identifying memories about a named NPC
	* npcissues: flaws of otherwise competent colleagues
	* ididstuff, theydidstuff: simple but powerful incidents
* Memory/Complex Memory: complexmemory, patterns of fairly detailed but not-unique events
* Memory/Fragments of Memory: new fragment patterns, e.g.
	* concerning lovers,
	* concerning the four seasons - "Window-panes rimed with frost."
	* details seen in a city,
	* details of a room, including
		* well-known inhabited space; one's own home: "The three-hundred-year-old door, iron-banded and whisper-smooth." "The neighbour [with the escapologist parrot | with the fondness for power metal at 2 AM | who was always cooking distractingly aromatic Somalian delicacies]".
	* details without context:
		* things owned, or worn, or read at about that time?
	* things related to work: "Hand-cramp from scribbled notes. Frustratingly illegible marginalia."
	* social details of a party, conference etc.
* Memory/Unique Memories
	* entirely new uniques
	* more variations on Part 2: Derring-Do, other than escapes
	


	YAK-SHAVING PRIORITY
Would be cool, but the cost/benefit is low; only spend time on them if it's fun.

* Memory/Gifts: tvseries, a pattern which generates movies or TV shows dependent on theme (so: Goth produces trashy vampire shows, etc.)
* Memory/Named Characters: the entire named-location section is already huge, but could potentially take new patterns?
* Memory/Named Characters/.../Namelists: more naming patterns for more cultures
* locations tied to scent-notes - so apple-blossom might occasionally place a memory in an apple orchard

	SAVE IT FOR 2.0
	
* Patterns wherein NPCs can recur across multiple memories, possibly telling the story of a relationship
* Tag locations according to local climate, resulting in different descriptions of seasons
* Tag time-of-day of memories, as above
* Take another pass at procgen phonology-based naming (ha ha ha sob)
