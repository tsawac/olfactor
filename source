[
From a summer, ten years ago, when you were living in a terrible flat in Paris and had croissants every morning and were having an ill-considered affair with a Cossack exile.

From a summer, ERAPHRASE, SITUATIONMEMORY and MEMIMPERFECT and were having an ill-considered affair with a Cossack exile.

Decanted after the debate with Magnus, which had built to a fever over the summer when Rome was too warm and Rachel sprawled across your bed on lazy mornings.

You first wore/smelled it on the dig in Cos, where it mingled with your sweat and the sea air and the fragrance of the raki Annabelle brought to your tent when you thought your surroundings were asleep.

You smelled it on the bridge where you left Christer for the last time, his angelic face struggling with his disappointment at your departure, as you strode onward to the sunlit cafe, a pouch of myrrh and silver at your waist.

Stolen from the alchemist's lab, overrun with blank-faced automata and distilled mercury, while Alastair the literary duelist looked at you with admiration and gathered the treatises you asked of him.

You first smelled this, in passing, on an elegant woman on the Pont-Neuf, and painstakingly reconstructed it before realising that it had been famous, thirty years before, in Persia.
