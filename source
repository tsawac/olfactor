Abooting is an action applying to nothing. Understand "about" as abooting.
Instead of abooting:
	say "Made for Emily Short.[p]Heavy Petal, which does not exist, is Sam Kabo Ashwell, Yoon Ha Lee, Cat Manning, and Caleb Wilson.";

startroom is a room.

After printing the banner text:
	say "Update 0.8: [b]Neroli[/b][p]";

[
UPDATE 0.8: NEROLI
	* expanded group actions
	* more lover fragments
	* pops now track depth;  this should make a/an work better
	* first properly-developed unique memory; unique memories now appear in regular output
	* various corpus additions
UPDATE 0.7: LEATHER
	* boots
		* in theory other scented objects may come along later, but mostly boots
	* address a bug with [*a] that makes it misfire on nested pops
	* some prepatory work on unique memories
UPDATE 0.6: DAMASK ROSE
	* more resonance-tagging
	* more yak-shaving on buildings
	* personal pronouns now randomly fix the gender of an NPC, if not already established
		* gender-tagged a lot of the names
	* a bunch of additions to NPC conversation topics
	* tweaked probability of less-complex memories down a bit
	* expanded selfreasons: brands, classes
UPDATE 0.5: LAVENDER
	* draft of intro text
	* colors; new suitoradjs
	* hopefully fixed a coupel of bugs with [*a]
	* substantial expansion of resonances; tagging , balancing incomplete
	* trying on Scents and Sensibility for size
UPDATE 0.4 : SPIKENARD
	* substantial (one might say excessive) rebalance of naming, including a lot of simple forename-surname stuff from various cultures
	* lots of small additions
	* parties
	* will not fix: rosewood is the same as bois de rose, but they *feel* different
UPDATE 0.3: GAIAC
	* work on resonance-storing:
		* introduced assoc, for directly storing words as resonances
	* fixed cleanup bug that froze game on 'reconsider' option
	* integrated festivals branch
UPDATE 0.2: PETITGRAIN
	* added fuzzy gender-tagging for NPC names, allowing for pronouns later
	* added naming-patterns for French; fucked around with distributions of naming
	* expanded places where memories can take place substantially, both as real-world lists and as generated
	* expanded academic events
UPDATE 0.1: JASMINE:
	* added basic, entirely-random resonances
	* added very specific menu-based choice
	* hunted out a bug that sometimes added scents to the notelist, and thus to options, without them appearing in the perfume description

Volume - I Can't Belive It's Not Tracery

[
This section is largely lifted from Apocalypse Fuel, and works along the same principles as Kate Compton's Tracery: lists which contain text strings, which might then refer to other lists, and so on.

In I7, this is done through the power of text subs. 'pop X' is the basic format, which means 'look through list X, pick a random entry, and say it.' Saying it may trigger more pops, and so on. There are variants of 'pop' for when you want slightly more specific behaviour:
	
* noreppop stores output to a list, and will not repeat entries from that list (the list empties after each player action).
* uppop and downpop change the case of the first letter in the resulting output.

Some pops are for specific kinds of thing:
	
* friendpop is for NPCs in memories. Right now it just adds their name to a list, 'clique', and does nothing further.
* scentpop is specifically for perfume notes: it stores the results in a distinct list, notelist, and does work adding adjectives.

Book - Scent Styles

[As a way of providing some unifying flavour - but not too much - to descriptions of scents, we have THEMES. Themes do several things:
	
1) Some scent notes are tagged as being related to themes. Appropriately-themed scent notes are slightly more likely to show up - the way this is done is imprecise and inefficient and might need reworking, alas.
2) Sometimes adds adjectives to the front of scent notes. This follows the general theming of the perfume, not of the scent note.
3) In some patterns, themes provide interstitial phrases from the 'composite' list, connecting scent notes - 'hawthorn | intertwines with | smoky oudh.'
4) For fantastical scent-notes formed as compound names, themes can provide nouns, as in 'bane|wood'.

Perfumes can have one or two themes.

Adding entirely new themes should be OK, but might be a fair amount of work; it should include tagging existing scent-notes.

Adjpop is a pop specifically for perfume adjectives. It only fires some of the time, prints a space after itself, and is significantly less likely if there's already a thematic adjective. It also was horribly expensive at runtime, and has been replaced.

The table lookup drastically slows things down.

To say adjpop (N - some text):
	[if N is a scent listed in the Table of Bound Adjectives and a random chance of 3 in 7 succeeds begin;
		let X be the adjs entry;
		[if a random chance of 1 in 8 succeeds, now X is manyadjs;]
		let XY be the substituted form of "[noreppop X]";
		say "[XY] ";
	otherwise ]if a random chance of 1 in 7 succeeds begin;
		let X be manyadjs;
		let XY be the substituted form of "[noreppop X]";
		say "[XY] ";
		end if;]

Book - Scent Notes

[
TO ADD NOTES:
	* if they have a special list of adjectives, put it at the bottom and refer to it with 'dject mynewscentflav',
	* if not, put [djectr] in front unless you want to avoid generic adjectives
	* tag any suitable themes with [b themename]; this isn't a precise art and it's best to err on the side of inclusion.

A lot of scents are assigned fairly arbitrarily to top, heart or base notes; feel free to move them around or duplicate them if you have Opinions on this.

Chapter - Hints

[Hints are where all the Weird Scents go - a grab-bag of ingredients that aren't usually in perfume, and things that are more conceptual or evocative than precise ingredients. In general, scent patterns probably shouldn't have more than one hint. The list currently is pretty damn short.

There's potential for separate hints based on theme, but that can probably wait for if/when the list gets unwieldy.]

['structures' is the list of all possible perfume descriptions. Right now there are only two patterns; one that varies a lot in length and draws on scenttops, scenthearts and scentbases; and a shorter one that uses theme-based connecting phrases.

Volume - Reflective Choice

[This is vestigial thus far, and is the next big To Do item for getting the interactive part working: creating lists of things, and synonyms for things that scent-notes could come to symbolise, for the player. 

Once that's done, individual bits of memory can be tagged with general moods, which will be suggested to the player - so, if oudh appears in a fragment about the end of a relationship, it might suggest something like 'oudh stands for letting things die'. The suggestions will probably be wildly off at least some of the time - we're inviting the player to do some hand-sorting on our behalf, really.

Anyway, don't worry about this just yet.]

Book - Memorialising

[
There are two lists here, both dealing with storing information from memories and converting it into resonances.

socdirect is a list of straight-up words. They will appear as-is, every time.  This is good for names of things.

assoc-list is not that. assoc-list is a list of lists. assoc-list is there to help generate new, but thematically similar, content when the player asks for new options.

To say m (N - a list of texts):
	add N to assoc-list;

Part - Naming And Unnecessity

Chapter - Gender

[Names *generally* track gender, but do so unreliably.

The tags 'masc' and 'fem' produce 90% that gender pronouns, 5% opposite-gender pronouns and 5% 'they'.
The tag 'neut' has an equal chance of all three.

If these tags get hit repeatedly, we keep the first result - this might not be the right behaviour, so keep an eye on it.

Chapter - Namelists

[
NAMING.

Naming NPCs thus far is a grab-bag of approaches, and I have yet to dial in how exactly I want to handle things; right now we have a mix of generated-then-cherry-picked conlang names, pseudo-Italian and Hellenic names, and (the only section with multi-word names) some fairly orthodox Anglo naming. This is an unsatisfactory state of affairs, and I'm not sure if the solution is More Things or a complete rethink.

(Yes, this is a wildly disproportionate amount of experimentation and effort spent on naming, but this is me.)

I have thus far held off from importing vast piles of name-generator stuff from other projects, partly because past experience has told me that trying to get name-gen patterns for every nation and culture is an effectively infinite task, and partly because I'm still not entirely sure what the success state looks like.

At some point there'll be a fuzzy system to infer NPC gender from forenames - in Apocalypse Fuel I dodged this question entirely and went with gender-neutral pronouns throughout, because genderfucky results are very Apocalypse World; here I would like names to agree with pronouns at least *some* of the time.

Section - Phonologies

[name2 is a phonology-based procgen pattern very roughly based on Mandarin; it produces one-word names of either one or two syllables, or two-word names of one syllable each.]

name2 is a list of texts that varies. name2 is 
{
"[uppop 2syll]",
"[uppop 2syll][2syll]",
"[uppop 2syll] [uppop 2syll]"
}.

2syll is a list of texts that varies. 2syll is {
"[pop 2incon][pop 2vow][one of][pop 2fincon][or][or][purely at random]"}.

2incon is a list of texts that varies. 2incon is {"c", "ch", "d", "dz", "f", "h", "j", "l", "m", "p", "q", "s", "sh", "t", "ts", "th", "tr", "v", "x", "y", "z", "zh"}.

[Name4 is roughly based on Persian phonology. Pure phonological generation produced a lot of tongue-bending monsters, so the current approach is to cherry-pick and use a list. If we stick with the phonology-procgen names (which I'm still not convinced about), it probably needs more regular structure - common suffixes, a surname system, that kind of thing.]

Book - Unique Memories

[In progress.

Each item on this list can come up only once; this is a very Venom / Beeswax kind of project in general, and this is the most beeswaxy bit.

Sam: And, right, I'd rather that patterns not go into unique memories *just* because they're highly specific, because unique memories as currently conceived is mostly more for Landmark Life Events
or, y'know, at least not super-often
Cat: yeah, "someone you banged wore a nice dress" better not be life-changing
Sam : so you say, but you didn't see this dress
Cat: that was my immediate thought after typing that, yes
good to see Heavy Petal has its priorities straight as a studio
Sam: pretty much the core brand tbh
Cat: I want business cards that say "it's a _very_ nice dress"

Volume - The Frame Story


When play begins:
say "There are other cases, other lists, lean and purpose-built and packaged for travel. You allow yourself a degree of sentiment in their selection, but that too serves a public purpose. This collection - sprawling, messy, incoherently themed and completely private - is a private matter. A giant's secret heart.

Every scent brings back memories that once meant something important. They might still. But scents change their character as they slowly break down, and history moulders if repeated by rote. Once in a while you clear an evening, unlock the chest, and unstopper your old selves to see what they are to you now.";

Instead of looking: do nothing.
