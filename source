UPDATE 0.13: PETRICHOR
	* fixed bug with banner display early in the game
	* hopefully fixed another a/an bug
	* end-of-game options
	* a lot more variation (some of it deeply yakshaven) on bottle descriptions
UPDATE 0.12: JONQUIL
	*  First run at Vorple interface
	* added a (vestigial?) unique about the first perfume the PC made

Volume - I Can't Belive It's Not Tracery

[
This section is largely lifted from Apocalypse Fuel, and works along the same principles as Kate Compton's Tracery: lists which contain text strings, which might then refer to other lists, and so on.

In I7, this is done through the power of text subs. 'pop X' is the basic format, which means 'look through list X, pick a random entry, and say it.' Saying it may trigger more pops, and so on. There are variants of 'pop' for when you want slightly more specific behaviour:
	
* noreppop stores output to a list, and will not repeat entries from that list (the list empties after each player action).
* uppop and downpop change the case of the first letter in the resulting output.

Some pops are for specific kinds of thing:
	
* friendpop is for NPCs in memories. Right now it just adds their name to a list, 'clique', and does nothing further.
* scentpop is specifically for perfume notes: it stores the results in a distinct list, notelist, and does work adding adjectives.

Book - Scent Styles

[As a way of providing some unifying flavour - but not too much - to descriptions of scents, we have THEMES. Themes do several things:
	
1) Some scent notes are tagged as being related to themes. Appropriately-themed scent notes are slightly more likely to show up - the way this is done is imprecise and inefficient and might need reworking, alas.
2) Sometimes adds adjectives to the front of scent notes. This follows the general theming of the perfume, not of the scent note.
3) In some patterns, themes provide interstitial phrases from the 'composite' list, connecting scent notes - 'hawthorn | intertwines with | smoky oudh.'
4) For fantastical scent-notes formed as compound names, themes can provide nouns, as in 'bane|wood'.

Perfumes can have one or two themes.

Adding entirely new themes should be OK, but might be a fair amount of work; it should include tagging existing scent-notes.

	now the themelist is {};
	let TRANSFER be a list of lists of text;
	let Z be the list of themes;
	sort Z in random order;
	let P be entry 1 in Z;
	theme-resonance P;

	if a random chance of 1 in 3 succeeds begin;
		let Q be entry 2 in Z;
		add Q to the themelist;
		theme-resonance Q;
	end if;
	
To themepick:
	if a random chance of 1 in 3 succeeds begin;

		let Z be entry X in N;
		add Z to the themelist;
	end if;
	repeat with F running through the themelist begin;
		theme-resonance F;
	end repeat;
	
To theme-resonance (N - a theme):
	if N is goth, add melancholy to assoc-list;
	if N is glam, add fashion to assoc-list;
	if N is spring, add beginnings to assoc-list;
	if N is fall, add endings to assoc-list;
	if N is lewd, add lust to assoc-list;
	if N is spring and the current season is "none", now the current season is "spring";
	if N is summer and the current season is "none", now the current season is "summer";
	if N is fall and the current season is "none", now the current season is "autumn";
	if N is winter and the current season is "none", now the current season is "winter";
	
	[say the themelist;
	say ": ";]

[Sometimes inserts a thematic adjective in front of a scent note; probability may need tweaking]

To say thematic:
	[Thematics are not the only adjective]
	if a random chance of 1 in 2 succeeds begin;
	let X be the number of entries in the themelist;
	let XA be a random number between 1 and X;
	let N be entry XA in the themelist;

	let FA be a random number from 1 to F;
	let X be entry FA in Z;

	[if a random chance of 1 in 3 succeeds, now Q is the generic composite list;]
	say "[pop Q]";

scent-themed is a truth-state that varies. scent-themed is false.

[Sometimes rejects and re-picks scent-notes if they don't match the theme;]

To say b (N - a theme):
	brand N;

To brand (N - a theme):
	if N is listed in the themelist, now scent-themed is true;
	
To decide whether shit is off-brand:
	if scent-themed is true, no;
	if a random chance of 1 in 3 succeeds, no;
	yes.
	
[Scentpop and notepop are similar, except that scentpop adds thematic adjectives.

The trick here is that scentpop/notepop cannot be self-referential, or weird shit starts to happen - a scentpop can include other kinds of pops, but not scentpops. Failing to observe this will mess with the notelist.]

To say scentpop (N - a list of texts):
	now scent-themed is false;
	let X be the number of entries in N;
	let Q be a random number between 1 and X;
	let Z be entry Q of N;
	now Z is the substituted form of Z; 
	while Z is listed in poplist or shit is off-brand begin;
		remove Z from notelist, if present;
		now Q is a random number between 1 and X;
		now Z is entry Q of N;
		now Z is the substituted form of Z; 
	end while;
	add Z to poplist;
	add Z to notelist;
	say "[thematic][Z]";
	
To say notepop (N - a list of texts):
	let X be the number of entries in N;
	let Q be a random number between 1 and X;
	let Z be entry Q of N;
	now Z is the substituted form of Z; 
	while Z is listed in poplist begin;
		remove Z from notelist, if present;
		now Q is a random number between 1 and X;
		now Z is entry Q of N;
		now Z is the substituted form of Z; 
	end while;
	add Z to poplist;
	add Z to notelist;
	say "[Z]";
	
noadj is a truth-state that varies. noadj is false.

To say cutadj:
	now noadj is true;

To say backadj:
	now noadj is false;

To say dject (N - a list of texts):
	if a random chance of 3 in 10 succeeds and noadj is false begin;
		let XY be the substituted form of "[noreppop N] ";
		say XY;
	otherwise if a random chance of 1 in 7 succeeds and noadj is false;
		let X be manyadjs;
		let XY be the substituted form of "[noreppop X]";
		say "[XY] ";
	end if;
	
To say djectr:
	if a random chance of 1 in 6 succeeds and noadj is false begin;
		let X be manyadjs;
		let XY be the substituted form of "[noreppop X]";
		say "[XY] ";
	end if;

[
Adjpop is a pop specifically for perfume adjectives. It only fires some of the time, prints a space after itself, and is significantly less likely if there's already a thematic adjective. It also was horribly expensive at runtime, and has been replaced.

The table lookup drastically slows things down.

To say adjpop (N - some text):
	[if N is a scent listed in the Table of Bound Adjectives and a random chance of 3 in 7 succeeds begin;
		let X be the adjs entry;
		[if a random chance of 1 in 8 succeeds, now X is manyadjs;]
		let XY be the substituted form of "[noreppop X]";
		say "[XY] ";
	otherwise ]if a random chance of 1 in 7 succeeds begin;
		let X be manyadjs;
		let XY be the substituted form of "[noreppop X]";
		say "[XY] ";
		end if;]

Book - Scent Notes

[
TO ADD NOTES:
	* if they have a special list of adjectives, put it at the bottom and refer to it with 'dject mynewscentflav',
	* if not, put [djectr] in front unless you want to avoid generic adjectives
	* tag any suitable themes with [b themename]; this isn't a precise art and it's best to err on the side of inclusion.

A lot of scents are assigned fairly arbitrarily to top, heart or base notes; feel free to move them around or duplicate them if you have Opinions on this.

Chapter - Hints

[Hints are where all the Weird Scents go - a grab-bag of ingredients that aren't usually in perfume, and things that are more conceptual or evocative than precise ingredients. In general, scent patterns probably shouldn't have more than one hint. The list currently is pretty damn short.

There's potential for separate hints based on theme, but that can probably wait for if/when the list gets unwieldy.]

Book - Assembler

['structures' is the list of all possible perfume descriptions. Right now there are only two patterns; one that varies a lot in length and draws on scenttops, scenthearts and scentbases; and a shorter one that uses theme-based connecting phrases.

Book - Memorialising

[
There are two lists here, both dealing with storing information from memories and converting it into resonances.

socdirect is a list of straight-up words. They will appear as-is, every time.  This is good for names of things.

assoc-list is not that. assoc-list is a list of lists. assoc-list is there to help generate new, but thematically similar, content when the player asks for new options.
]

To say m (N - a list of texts):
	add N to assoc-list;
	
assoc-list is a list of lists of texts that varies.

socdirect is a list of texts that varies.

To say assoc (N - a list of texts):
	let Q be the substituted form of "[pop N]";
	if the number of characters in Q > 0 and character number 1 in Q matches the text "\s"  begin;
		replace character number 1 in Q with "";
	end if;
	if the number of characters in Q > 1 and Q matches the regular expression "^n\s" begin;
		replace the matched text with "";
	end if;
	add Q to socdirect;
	say Q;
	
[Known bug: assoc is too sticky, most obviously because it sometimes adds cities to associations that were never mentioned by the text.]

Part - Naming And Unnecessity

Chapter - Gender

[Names *generally* track gender, but do so unreliably.

The tags 'masc' and 'fem' produce 90% that gender pronouns, 5% opposite-gender pronouns and 5% 'they'.
The tag 'neut' has an equal chance of all three.

'hardfem', 'hardmasc' and 'hardnb' always produce their respective genders, as long as a gender is not already set.

If these tags get hit repeatedly, we keep the first result - this might not be the right behaviour, so keep an eye on it.

NPC-gender is a number that varies. [0: unestablished, 1: nonbinary, 2: female, 3: male.]

Chapter - Namelists

[
NAMING.

Naming NPCs thus far is a grab-bag of approaches, and I have yet to dial in how exactly I want to handle things; right now we have a mix of generated-then-cherry-picked conlang names, pseudo-Italian and Hellenic names, and (the only section with multi-word names) some fairly orthodox Anglo naming. This is an unsatisfactory state of affairs, and I'm not sure if the solution is More Things or a complete rethink.

(Yes, this is a wildly disproportionate amount of experimentation and effort spent on naming, but this is me.)

I have thus far held off from importing vast piles of name-generator stuff from other projects, partly because past experience has told me that trying to get name-gen patterns for every nation and culture is an effectively infinite task, and partly because I'm still not entirely sure what the success state looks like.

At some point there'll be a fuzzy system to infer NPC gender from forenames - in Apocalypse Fuel I dodged this question entirely and went with gender-neutral pronouns throughout, because genderfucky results are very Apocalypse World; here I would like names to agree with pronouns at least *some* of the time.

Section - Phonologies

[name2 is a phonology-based procgen pattern very roughly based on Mandarin; it produces one-word names of either one or two syllables, or two-word names of one syllable each.]

name2 is a list of texts that varies. name2 is 
{
"[uppop 2syll]",
"[uppop 2syll][2syll]",
"[uppop 2syll] [uppop 2syll]"
}.

2syll is a list of texts that varies. 2syll is {

[Name4 is roughly based on Persian phonology. Pure phonological generation produced a lot of tongue-bending monsters, so the current approach is to cherry-pick and use a list. If we stick with the phonology-procgen names (which I'm still not convinced about), it probably needs more regular structure - common suffixes, a surname system, that kind of thing.]

Book - Unique Memories

[In progress.

Each item on this list can come up only once; this is a very Venom / Beeswax kind of project in general, and this is the most beeswaxy bit.

Sam: And, right, I'd rather that patterns not go into unique memories *just* because they're highly specific, because unique memories as currently conceived is mostly more for Landmark Life Events
or, y'know, at least not super-often
Cat: yeah, "someone you banged wore a nice dress" better not be life-changing
Sam : so you say, but you didn't see this dress
Cat: that was my immediate thought after typing that, yes
good to see Heavy Petal has its priorities straight as a studio
Sam: pretty much the core brand tbh
Cat: I want business cards that say "it's a _very_ nice dress"

Volume - The Frame Story

When play begins:
say "There are other perfume-boxes, other lists, sharply curated according to audience. You allow yourself a degree of sentiment in their selection, but that too serves a public purpose. This collection - messy, unfashionable, incoherently themed - is an entirely private matter. ";
place a link to the command "advance" reading "A giant's secret heart.", without showing the command.

Advancing is an action applying to nothing. Understand "advance" as advancing.

Instead of advancing when advnum is 1:
say "Each scent brings back memories that once meant something important. They might still. But scents change their character as they slowly break down, and history moulders if repeated by rote. Once in a while you clear an evening, unlock the chest, and unstopper your old selves to see ";
place a link to the command "k" reading "what they are to you now.", without showing the command;
if Vorple is not supported, say "what they are to you now.";
now advnum is 2;
now banner-num is 2;


Instead of looking: do nothing.
